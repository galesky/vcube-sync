# VCUBE-Sync

VCube-Sync, is a system that uses a virtual hypercube topology as the basis for replication of a Conflict-free Replicated Data Types (CRDT) based data store. CRDT can ensure consistency in a deterministic and conflict-free manner. At the same time, hypercubes have been previously used for message distribution due to their fault tolerance and logarithmic latency, and also enable heuristics based on knowledge of the structured overlay.
